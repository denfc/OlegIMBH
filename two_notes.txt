# Get a longer sample to verify j.cmatch values represent match counts
function analyze_index_matches(idx)
    # Find all occurrences in j.matched
    matches = findall(x -> x == idx, j.matched[1])
    match_count = length(matches)
    match_values = j.matched[2][matches]
    
    println("\nIndex $idx:")
    println("  Number of matches in j.matched: $match_count")
    println("  Matches with: $match_values")
    println("  Value in j.cmatch: $(j.cmatch[1][idx])")
    
    # Verify counts match
    @assert j.cmatch[1][idx] == match_count "Mismatch between j.cmatch value and actual match count"
end

# Test first few indices that appear in matches
indices_to_check = [8118, 9537, 9236]
foreach(analyze_index_matches, indices_to_check)

This confirms j.cmatch[1] values represent the count of matches for each index in j.matched[1].

This error typically occurs when there's an issue with Julia's task scheduling system in Pluto. Here's a step-by-step plan to fix it:

First try clearing Julia's compiled cache
If that doesn't work, reinstall Pluto
â”” schedule: Task not runnable Stacktrace: [

# 1. Exit Julia REPL and delete compiled cache
rm -rf ~/.julia/compiled

# 2. Start Julia REPL and reinstall Pluto

# In Julia REPL:
import Pkg
Pkg.update()  # Update all packages first
Pkg.resolve()  # Resolve dependencies
Pkg.precompile() # Force precompilation of all packages

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

This one finally worked:
1)
julia --compiled-modules=yes


2) Or from within Julia REPL:
# Clear package compiler cache
using Pkg
Pkg.rm(DEPOT_PATH[1], "compiled")

rm("$(DEPOT_PATH[1])/compiled", recursive=true, force=true) 

# Force recompilation
Pkg.instantiate()
Pkg.precompile()
