Dear Dr. Bouy,

I want to thank you for your `crossmatch_angular` Julia code and also ask why (the old Julia) `crossmatch` code had no difficulty with the transposed arrays in the call from `crossmatch_angular`, which I changed to ind, dist = crossmatch(Matrix(Y1), Matrix(Y2), max_y) to get it to work (along with adding a few dots).

Also, what criterion do you like for a match of coordinates?

Again, thanks!
